I'm Elliot Nelson, I like to support Science by making & keeping hardware and software working. I currently work at Diamond Light Source as a Senior Support Scientist in the Macromolecular Crystallography Vilage. I finished my PhD in 2019, working on Occupancy in Fragment Screening Crystallographic Datasets, and have worked at Diamond since.
